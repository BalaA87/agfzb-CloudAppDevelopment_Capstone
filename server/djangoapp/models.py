# <HINT> Create a Car Model model `class CarModel(models.Model):`:
# - Many-To-One relationship to Car Make model (One Car Make has many Car Models, using ForeignKey field)
# - Name
# - Dealer id, used to refer a dealer created in cloudant database
# - Type (CharField with a choices argument to provide limited choices such as Sedan, SUV, WAGON, etc.)
# - Year (DateField)
# - Any other fields you would like to include in car model
# - __str__ method to print a car make object


# <HINT> Create a plain Python class `CarDealer` to hold dealer data


# <HINT> Create a plain Python class `DealerReview` to hold review data
